Java Infra Map is an open-source web map that visualises infrastructure development across Java Island. It provides essential base infrastructure layers alongside curated layers of featured infrastructure projects.

Each featured project is enriched with the latest five relevant news updates, automatically researched and summarised using AI to ensure the information remains current and insightful.

As an open-source initiative, Java Infra Map welcomes community contributions. Contributors can help expand the map by adding new featured infrastructure projects and improving existing data.
